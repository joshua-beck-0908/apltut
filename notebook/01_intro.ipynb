    "> APL is an array language, and one of the oldest programming languages still in use today, next to FORTRAN, Lisp and COBOL. APL uses its own curious-looking symbols, like ‚çé‚åΩ‚çï‚åà*‚óã‚â°‚ç¨, rather than reserved words written out in English like most other languages, like C or Python. As a language, APL sits at a very high level of abstraction, making it well suited to ultra-concise formulations of algorithms.\n",

    "Interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't learnt a symbol language before, and that looks pretty intigating.\n",
